# AI SQL Agent 

The AI SQL Agent is a powerful tool that allows users to interact with SQL databases using natural language queries. Powered by Groq's LLM (Large Language Model) and built with Streamlit, this application simplifies database exploration, querying, and analysis. Whether you're a data analyst, developer, or business user, this tool makes it easy to extract insights from your SQL databases without writing complex SQL queries.
